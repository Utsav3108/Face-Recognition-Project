# Face-Recognition-Project
This is `Django` Project developed as part of my college project. 

- `FaceRecognition_website` is base folder for this Django project. I have removed Settings.py file you can contact me if you want it.

- `FRphase1` is the App folder which contains view.py, that processs the backend of this project, urls.py, that routes the pages and models.py, which contains database models of this project. 

- `templates` folder contains all the HTML pages associated with the project.

- `media` folder contains `pic` folder in it. Here the system saves the pictures of the user that are saved in the Database, that is `MySQL`

- you can refer to `program4.py` to get the basic idea of how the System is working at the backend level.

To clone the project:
`git clone https://github.com/Utsav3108/Face-Recognition-Project.git`
